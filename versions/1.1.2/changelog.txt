# V 1.1.2

**Non-Premium Support Update**  

## Added Mods

- **[Be Quiet Negotiator](https://modrinth.com/mod/be-quiet-negotiator)** [1.0.1] - Allows modded clients to connect through Velocity proxy and auth systems without handshake errors

## What's New

Non-premium users can now join the MullV Network without issues. Previously, the authentication system redirected players to a limbo server that didn't support modded clients, causing connection failures. This mod bypasses NeoForge handshake negotiation when connecting through the proxy, letting you connect smoothly.

## Technical Details

The mod works by suppressing NeoForge's network negotiation when connecting to vanilla or non-NeoForge servers (like our Velocity proxy). This prevents disconnects during authentication without affecting gameplay once you're on the actual modded server.

## Notes

Fully compatible with existing worlds and all previous versions. Server-side changes were also made to support this workflow.
